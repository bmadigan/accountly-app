## Accountly

A simple TALL Stack application.

TailwindCSS, AlpineJS, Laravel, Livewire

## Installation

This is just a standard installation of Laravel:

`composer install`

`npm install && npm run dev`

`php artisan migrate:fresh && php artisan db:seed`

## Note:

The site was built using Pravatar.cc for development purposes and it works great at times and at 
times it is really slow. You may notice the gravatars are not generating.
It depends on their service which has been pretty bad as of late.

So, I am using a random user faces ui generator for now.
